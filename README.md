# Data Analytics Project
This is an end-to-end sports data analytics project where we cover web scraping (from the ESPN Cricinfo website), Python, Pandas, and Power BI to perform analyses on T20 World Cup cricket data. In this project, we use cricket T20 World Cup (2022) data to build insights on the best 11 players team that we can assemble from the earth to play with aliens.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

1. Web scraping the data from the [**ESPN Cricinfo website**](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2021-22-1267897) using Bright Data.
2. Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas.
3. Building dashboards in Power BI to visualize and analyze the data.
4. Identifying the best 11 players team based on the analysis to play with aliens.

## Project Materials
The project materials are included in this repository and are organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed data files.
* **notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning and analysis.
* **'reports/'**: Contains the final reports generated from the analysis.
* **'dashboards/'**: Contains the Power BI dashboards used to visualize the data.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages listed in the **'requirements.txt'** file.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the **notebooks/** directory and run them to perform data cleaning and analysis.
4. Open the Power BI dashboards in the **dashboards/** directory to visualize the data.
5. Review the final reports in the **reports/** directory to see the results of the analysis.

## Conclusion
This is a solid data science project that will help you to build skills in web scraping, data cleaning and transformation, data analysis, and data visualization. It is also a great addition to your resume and will make it stand out in the competition. Feel free to use this project as a template for your own data analytics projects.
